    "A singular (or degenerate) matrix is a matrix that can not be inverted. A lot of this post will discuss the bridge between theory and practice, so I'll further specify that a singular amtrix is a matrix that can't theoretically be inverted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, practically we can do all sorts of silly things. There are many functions that one can run on a computer that will try and 'succeed' at inverting a sigular matrix. I put succeed in quotes as any function that returns a result when trying to invert a singular matrix is returning nonsense. This is why it is important not to blindly trust functions for random packages you find on the internet! On the other hand, there may be matrices that are theoretically invertable but impossible to practically invert for a variety of reasons that I'll discuss in a bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's review the definition of 'invertable'. A matrix is invertable if there exists a square ($nxn$) matrix B such that $AB = BA = I$ where $I$ is the identity matrix. Matrix inversion is the process of finding matrix $B$ for matrix $A$ that satisfies the equation above. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Asside:** I'd like to burrow a little deeper into what a singular matrix is, but it's a bit mathy. Feel free to skip this if you aren't a hard core math nerd. One can show that non-singular coefficient matrices lead to unique solutions for every vector of constants one could choose. Singular matrices, on the other hand, have non-trivial nullspaces (see proof NMTNS at bottom). For vector contraints b, the system $\\mathcal{LS}(A,b)$ could be inconsistant (i.e. no solution). However, if $\\mathcal{LS}(A,b)$ has at elast one solution $(w)$, then it will have infinitely many solutions (see proof PSPHS)! A system of equations with a singular coefficient matrix will never have a unique solution. \n",

    "Another good piece of advice to to looka t different methods of inverting matrices. Instead of using [Cramer's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix#Analytic_solution) or standard funtions like `np.linal.inv`, try using SVD decomposition or LU decomposition. You can even find some very nice numerically stable methods leveraging cholesky decomposition (a favorite for Gaussian Process models). \n",

    "**Author's Note:** The observant reader may note that earlier I said that singular matrices are very rare...so why worry about them? Well, they are rare in the sense that you are unlikely to stumble arocss one when randomly sampling many common distributions from the exponential family. However, there are good reasons why we may run acorss them commonly in the real world. Covariances matrices, for example, are often build around multiple samples from a test set. Many data points/samples may be identical or very close resulting in rows/columns in the matrix that are identical/close to identical. This is why we regularize the matrix we want to invert by adding a very small number to the 'ridge' or 'principal diagonal' of the matrix (just like in [ridge regression](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03208332.pdf)) in the same way that we might add a noise term in the noisy case of Gaussian Process regression! In layman's terms: this is why we add a small number to the matrix diagonal. If you'd like to read more about this in the case of Gaussian Processes, you can check out equation 3.26 on page 45 of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning. "

    "Well now you know how to find hot singular matrices in your area and even how to work around them! My advice is to always check your matrices before you try to invert them and have a plan for how to treat the matrix if it is poorly conditioned. "

    "Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix. Then $A$ is nonsingular if and only if the null space of $A$ is the set containing only the zero vector, i.e. $\\mathcal{N}(A)=\\{0\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: The null space of a square matrix, $A$, is equal to the set of solutions to the homogeneous system, $\\mathcal{LS}(A,0)$. A matrix is nonsingular if and only if the set of solutions to the homogeneous system, $\\mathcal{LS}(A,0)$, has only a trivial solution. These two observations may be chained together to construct the two proofs necessary for each half of this theorem.\n",
