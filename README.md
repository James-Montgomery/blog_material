# Voice Recognition

Almost all of the machine learning I use in my work I did not learn at a tutorial or in a class. Instead, I saw some really cool product and went "wow, how do I build that?". That is how this project started. I've always loved voice recognition and I dug into the literature to figure out how to build a simple voice recognition model. Here i use the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approach. I may add examples for the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches that are more popular but also much more complicated.
