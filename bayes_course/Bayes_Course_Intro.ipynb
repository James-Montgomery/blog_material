       "What is this course about? I recently started a reinforcement learning project where the reward function of the RL learner was a bayesian model. Of course...I knew almost nothing about bayesian statistics before building out this RL learner! So, I spent a lot of time reading and trying to implement various online tutorials and research papers. This course is a collection of (mostly) other people's tutorials, but refactored to work together and provide a more holistic view of bayesian statistics than any one of these myriad of tutorials did originally. I've rewritten extensive portions of many of these tutorials and I apologize for any errors I may have accidentally introduced. I try to provide links or references to any and all resources I borrowed from to create this course in the sections where I reference said material.\n",

       "All of the content is stored in Jupyter Notebooks. I recommend downloading the content locally. This will let you play with the code and actually run the examples for yourself. For best practices, I also recommend using a conda virtual environment to manage dependancies (take a look at the setup.sh file if you need help setting up your env and/or check out the [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)).   \n",
