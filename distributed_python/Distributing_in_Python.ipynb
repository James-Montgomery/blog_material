    "## Distributing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so you've heard about all the hype around distributed computing and want to get in on the goodness! Or maybe you're a distributed computing veteren, but still a python neophyte? Either way, this blog post may be just tht epython distributed computing primer that you need to get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "I've recently needed to start diving into the wacky world of distributed computing in python. Typically I only use distributed computing for feature processing in production models. When you have tons of data streaming into your model and need to clean and process it quickly...well scala spark can do wonders! Of course there are plenty of other nice tools like Flink as well, but my collegues like scala spark so scala spark it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's only recently that I've been getting involved with distributed computing in python. Mostly this has to do with research I'm doing around scaling stats models to rediculously large datasets and very complex processes. Unlike most of my blogs where I bury the lead a bit and try to paint a story (I love stories), I'm starting this blog with the punch line:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python was not made to be distributed, so distributing in python is not as easy as in other languages\n",
    "2. Not all distributing is made equally. \n",
    "    1. Handling IO for a smooth user inerface (i.e. in a web app): Use multi-threading\n",
    "    2. Parallel processes on a single machine: Multi-processing with shared memory\n",
    "    3. Parallel processes on multiple machines: Multi-processing without shared memory\n",
    "    \n",
    "All of these use cases can be handled by Dask, but Dask is a relatively new package and I've hit a few pot holes trying to use it. The first and second use cases can be handled by the Multiprocessing package. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can theoretically also use pyspark to do distributed computing in python, but I don't recommend it. Pyspark has given me and collegues many issues in the past. Dask is probably a better choice. \n",

    "### What is Multi-Threading? \n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, a thread is a 'thread of execution'. Each thread represents a task. A process may contain multiple threads whcih all share the same resoruces (different processes do not share resources). Threads are light weight (they are the smallest unit of processing that can be performed on an OS) and have a very specific use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since threads share resoruces, they are bad for dsitributing work acorss the CPU. If you have 24 virtual cores in your laptop, threading will only use the cores available to the process they are part of. Well that sucks! Why would we ever use threads? Well, imagine we were building a website and a user clicks on a button that uploads a picture and takes the user to a different aopge that displays that picture. It might take a while to upload the picture. If we try to go to the enw apge before the picture uploads all hell will break loose. With multithreading we can spin up a new thred to handle the upload and WAIT for this thread to complete before the original thread (handling cahnges between web pages) moves the user to the new page. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is for these use cases, where networking, data, and I/O (Input/Output) are important, that we might want to use multi-threading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go too deep, let's pull out the code. Let's say we have a process that needs to download from four different data sources at once. None of the downloads depends on the others so we can run the independantly. each download takes 1 second. How long does this take to do on a single thread?"

Python objects have a globally enforced lock that prevents you from getting yourself into trouble. These saftey rails are nice for preventing you from shooting yourself in the foot in many cases, but limit our python process to using only one core of the CPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to use more than one core. Now certain versions of python do not have the GIL, like iron python an Jython. However, we usually aren't working in Jython so let's assume we need to work around the GIL to make use of multiple cores in our CPU. To use multiple cores we need to spin up multiple processes! Each process will have it's own GIL and memory.\n",

    "I will warn you, while we are taking advantage of modern dat cpu architectures and leveraging multiple cores, there is a lot of overhead with multi-processing and it should only be used when needed. Many python pacakges (numpy for example) are very well optimized and can run quickly even without parallelisation. \n",

    "We first create a dask client (like the multiprocessing process pool). I've learned that for a number fo edge cases in certain evironments in python that Client will through errors if created with processes=True. I won't dive into the how's and why's, but it's worth noting in case your dask client starts acting up for seemingly no reason. Luckily we don't need to worry about setting a pool size!\n",

    "We create a dask worker simialrly to how we create a worker fucntion for multiprocessing. Much of the code is the same as before. I'll note that I am creating a scattered version of the beta array. I do this because each needs access to that same object and scattering the object among the workers saves on pickling costs for sending information between/to each worker. Remember, everything sent to the workers must be pickled and serialized! I then create a lsit of future objects which will be the results of the worker processes. \n",
