    "# Particle Swarm Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "As a machine learning engineer with an educational background in physics, I've always loved the intersection of physics and machine learning. Many of my collegues are physicists and many of the models and methods we use come from the field of physics. \n",
    "\n",
    "One neat method I've always liked is particle swarm optimization (PSO). It is conceptually related to the MCMC methods Ensemble MCMC and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In this post I will walk through how PSO works and code an example of PSO from scratch in python. Here we explore the classic PSO algorithm, but there is a bayesian version used in the field of bayesian optimization that I encourage you to look up if you enjoy this post. "

    "PSO was proposed in 1995 by Eberhart and Kennedy. It was originally intended for simulating social behavior using patterns inspired by the was birds flock and schools of fish swim. \n",
    "\n",
    "PSO is a metaheuristic technicque that makes few to no assumptions about the function being optimized. It is very useful in cases where the search space is high dimensional, non-convex, and/or non-continuous. One great aspect of PSO is that it does not require the function being optimized to be differentiable as does gradient descent and quasi-newton methods."

    "The high level idea behind PSO is that we release many different \"particles\" into the search space. These aprticles move in such a way that they tend to congregate around minima in the optimization topography. Heuristically, you can think of dumping marbles into a funnels such that they all end up falling into the center no matter where they started from. We start by giving our particles the propeties of position (along the optimization plane) and velosity:\n",

    "\n",
    "So what are these terms? Since each particle is \"learning\" about a different section of the optimization plane, we want the particles to share some information to alert each other when one has found a position that might be the global optima. This is what the social term does. On the other hand, each particle should have some ability to pursue promising elads on it's own; this is the cognitive term. These terms may agree or fight each other."
